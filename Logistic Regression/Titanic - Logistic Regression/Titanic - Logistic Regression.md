# Logistic Regression with Python

For this project I will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](httpswww.kaggle.comctitanic). This is a very famous data set and very often first step in machine learning! 

Here we are predicting a classification- survival or deceased.

It Begins wiht implementation of Logistic Regression in Python for classification.

Semi-cleaned version of the titanic data set is used.
